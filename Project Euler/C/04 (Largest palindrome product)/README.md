# Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Solution: 993 x 913 = 906609
After few hours on this problem I did it in a wrong way. My solution was: 995 x 583 = 580085, because of checking first every
combination from 998 x 999 to 998 x 1 and so on. [eagletmt](https://github.com/eagletmt/project-euler-c/blob/master/1-9/problem4.c)
 made this work in 30 lines, and used math, while I used stack.
